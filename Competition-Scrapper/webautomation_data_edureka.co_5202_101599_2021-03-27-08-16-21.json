Whenever there’s a ticket for an issue, the first place she checks in, is the logs in the designated servers. She keeps searching and searching for related words or keyword match. Meanwhile there is change in logs every minute, and this is making her search, more and more hectic. ~.~ How can we help her? ~.~ SOLUTION ~.~ : ~.~ Well this is where ELK stack comes into the picture ~.~ ELK comes with elastic search, logstash and kibana stacked altogether to give her a full analytics system. ~.~ Elastic Search enables her to search logs easily and get to know the issue and resolve it in a faster manner; not only that she can get proactive by analyzing the logs, and see if any of those customers are facing any issues or failures. ~.~ Now she can log into Kibana and search for relevant keywords easily.

After learning how to stash your first event, you can go on to create a more advanced pipeline that takes Apache web logs as input, parses the logs, and writes the parsed data to an Elasticsearch cluster.

Her query was not able to remove distinction between singular and plural words, or between tenses. She even faced problem with typos and various other problem. Let’s help Alice in solving her issues by training her on how to deal with human language for improving performance. ~.~ Objectives: ~.~ At the end of this lesson, you should be able to: ~.~ • Remove diacritics like ´, ^, and ¨ so that a search for rôle will also match role, and vice versa using Normalizing Tokens. ~.~ • Remove the distinction between singular and plural—fox versus foxes—or between tenses—jumping versus jumped versus jumps—by stemming each word to its root form in Reducing Words to Their Root Form. ~.~ • Remove commonly used words or stopwords like the, and, and or to improve search performance in Stopwords: Performance Versus Precision. ~.~ • Including synonyms so that a query for quick could also match fast, or UK could match United Kingdom with the help of Synonyms. ~.~ • Check for misspellings or alternate spellings, or match on homophones—words that sound the same, like their versus there, meat versus meet versus mete using Typos and Misspellings. ~.~ Topics: ~.~ • Getting Started with languages ~.~ • Identifying Words ~.~ • Normalizing Tokens ~.~ • Reducing Words to their Root Form ~.~ • Stopwords: Performance versus Precision ~.~ • Synonyms ~.~ • Typos and Misspellings ~.~ Hands On: ~.~ Above all topics are hands-on intensive ~.~ Get detailed course syllabus in your inbox ~.~ Download Curriculum ~.~ Goal: ~.~ Alice leaned all about how to search through her data, now once data is searched she needs to get a higher-level overview of the dataset and perform queries on it to get her answers in near-real time. This has made her task very tedious and tiring. Let’s ease her problem by training her with aggregation. ~.~ Aggregations will allow her to ask sophisticated questions of her data in near real time. With search, we have a query and we want to find a subset of documents that match the query. We are looking for the needle(s) in the haystack. ~.~ With aggregations, we zoom out to get an overview of our data. Instead of looking for individual documents, we want to analyze and summarize our complete set of data: ~.~ Objectives: At the end of this module you will be able to: ~.~  Understand the concepts of buckets and metrics ~.~  Build bar chart with buckets ~.~  Look at the time using Date Histogram ~.~  Filter queries and aggregation ~.~  Sort multivalue bucket ~.~ Topics: ~.~ • High Level Concepts ~.~ • Getting started with Aggregation ~.~ • Time Analysis ~.~ • Filtering Queries and Aggregations ~.~ • Sorting Multivalue Buckets ~.~ • Approximate Aggregation ~.~ • Doc Values and Field Data ~.~ Hands On: ~.~ Above all topics are hands-on intensive ~.~ Get detailed course syllabus in your inbox ~.~ Download Curriculum ~.~ Goal: ~.~ Alice was well-versed in working with SQL she thought that for handling relationships, the golden rule of relational database- normalize your data will be applicable in Elastic Search too. But as a matter of fact, this golden rule does not apply to Elastic Search. Joining entities at query time is expensive—the more joins that are required, the more expensive the query. Performing joins between entities that live on different hardware is so expensive that it is just not practical. In this module let’s discover how data is modelled in Elastic Search. ~.~ Objectives: ~.~ At the end of this lesson, you should be able to: ~.~ • Compare Elasticsearch with RDBMS ~.~ • Get the best search result by learning Denormalizing Data ~.~ • Perform action with Nested Objects ~.~ • Understand Parent-Child Relationship ~.~ • Finally conclude the module with concept of shards and replicas ~.~ Topics ~.~ : ~.~ • Elastic Search vs RDBMS ~.~ • Handling Relationships ~.~ • Nested Objects ~.~ • Parent-Child Relationship ~.~ • Designing for Scale ~.~ Hands On: ~.~ Above all topics are hands-on intensive ~.~ Get detailed course syllabus in your inbox ~.~ Download Curriculum ~.~ Goal: ~.~ The beauty of Elasticsearch is that it allows you to combine geolocation with full-text search, structured search, and analytics. ~.~ For instance: show me restaurants that mention PIZZA, BURGER, and are within a 5-minute walk, and are open at 11 p.m., and then rank them by a combination of user rating, distance, and price. ~.~ Objectives: ~.~ At the end of this module you will be able to: ~.~ • Understand the concepts of Geo Points ~.~ • Aggregate Geo Distance ~.~ • Understand Geohash and aggregate geohash grid ~.~ • Learn about different Geo Shapes ~.~ Topics: ~.~ • Geo Points ~.~ • Geohashes ~.~ • Geo Aggregations ~.~ • Geo Shapes ~.~ Hands On: ~.~ Above all topics are hands-on intensive ~.~ Get detailed course syllabus in your inbox ~.~ Download Curriculum ~.~ Goal: ~.~ Learn to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices.
